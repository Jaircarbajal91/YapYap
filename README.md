# `YapYap`

YapYap aims to mimic the look and functionality of Discord.

Our goals for this project were the following:

1. Work with WebSockets and Socket.IO
2. Refresh and refine our knowledge of React and Node.js

## Technologies

#### Front-End
- React
- Redux
- CSS

#### Back-End

- Express.js
- Node.js
- Sequelize
- Socket.io

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Run `npm i` in the root, `backend`, and `frontend` directories to install necessary dependencies
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory following the `.envExample` file
4. In your `backend` directory, run `sh migrate.sh` and `sh seed.sh` to create and seed the database
5. Run `npm start` in first the `backend`, then `frontend` directories. The app will be available at `localhost:3000`
